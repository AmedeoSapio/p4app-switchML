# RDMA sends messages then the NIC splits a message into multiple packets.
# Thus the number of elements in a message must be a multiple of a packet's number of elements.
# This reduced the overheads involved in sending packet by packet. However,

# make us retransmit the whole message. Hence you should tweak this value until you find the sweet spot.
